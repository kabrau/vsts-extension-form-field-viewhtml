# vsts-extension-ts-seed-simple #

Describe your extension here. This description will be shown in the marketplace. You can use *Markdown*.

https://github.com/cschleiden/vsts-extension-ts-seed-simple


### Usage ###

1. Clone the repository
1. `npm install` to install required local dependencies
2. `npm install -g grunt` to install a global copy of grunt (unless it's already installed)
2. `grunt` to build and package the application

#### Grunt ####

Three basic `grunt` tasks are defined:

* `build` - Compiles TS files in `scripts` folder
* `package-dev` - Builds the development version of the vsix package
* `package-release` - Builds the release version of the vsix package
* `publish-dev` - Publishes the development version of the extension to the marketplace using `tfx-cli`
* `publish-release` - Publishes the release version of the extension to the marketplace using `tfx-cli`

Note: To avoid `tfx` prompting for your token when publishing, login in beforehand using `tfx login` and the service uri of ` https://marketplace.visualstudio.com`.

#### Including framework modules ####

The VSTS framework is setup to initalize the requirejs AMD loader, so just use `import Foo = require("foo")` to include framework modules.

#### VS Code ####

The included `.vscode` config allows you to open and build the project using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
